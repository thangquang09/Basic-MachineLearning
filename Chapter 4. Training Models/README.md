# Training Models

In this chapter, we will start by looking at the `linear regression` model, one of the simplest models there is. We will discuss two very difference ways to train it:

- Using 'closed-form' equation.
- Using `Gradient Descent` (GD)

Next we will looking at `polynomial regression`, a more complex model that can fit nonlinear datasets. We will explore how to detect over-fitting by using `learning curves`.

Finally, we will examine two more models are commonly used for classification task: `logistic regression` and `softmax regression`.

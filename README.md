About basic Machine Learning Algorithms, coding with simple exercises, enjoy!

My self-study process of Machine Learning is based on the book Basic Machine Learning by author Vu Huu Tiep and Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 3rd Edition by Aurélien Géron. Enjoy Machine Learning!
